# agot-liberation-quest

This is a fix for what I consider to be a design flaw in the [CK2 Game of Thrones mod][1]. When playing as
Daenerys Targaryen in the mod, after you've tamed Drogon and saved Meereen from the slavers led by Yunkai,
you're forced into an endless series of wars against all the slaver cities in Essos. At best, this takes
about ten years. It can go on indefinitely if the series of wars you're stuck in take so long that cities
you've previous defeated reinstitute slavery and you have to fight them again.

This mod gets removes this liberation quest and instead gives you a choice between returning to Westeros
after Meereen is secured (as Daenerys actually does in the series) and staying in Meereen. It's a very quick
and dirty hack, and it's not perfect in the current incarnation--there's a missing localization string, and
a blank event window, but no serious problems.
